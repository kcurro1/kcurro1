## Projects
### Identifying Diabetic Retinopathy with Machine Learning
Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of vision impairment and blindness among individuals with diabetes. Early detection is crucial in preventing the progression of this condition, as symptoms often do not appear until the disease has reached an advanced stage. This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting diabetic retinopathy from retinal scans. The goal is to improve diagnostic accuracy, enable early intervention, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes.

### American Red Cross Database Simulation
The American Red Cross is a non-profit organization that focuses on blood donation and disaster relief. This project focuses on designing and implementing a donor database for the American Red Cross to track donations efficiently. We created an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram, defined constraints, and developed a relational schema. After creating our database, we implemented queries to analyze donor activity, allocation of funds, and branch contributions, and we translated this structure into an ORM implementation with SQLAlchemy.

### Qwixx Simulation
Qwixx Dice Game is a board game that is based on dice rolls and strategic decision-making. This project aims to determine the most effective strategy for maximizing a player's chances of winning while examining the probabilistic nature of outcomes and overall strategy effectiveness. By using Monte Carlo simulations to estimate expected scores, game length distributions, and the impact of different player strategies, we identified the optimal approach for Qwixx and assessed the role that randomness plays in determining success.

### Spotify and YouTube Trends Analysis
For my final project in the Fundamentals of R course at Loyola, I combined my love for music with data analysis by exploring notable trends in both Youtube and Spotify's user activity dataset by using data visualization and manipulation in R.

## Awards & Publications

### [Inducible Reporter Lines for Tissue-specific Monitoring of Drosophila Circadian Clock Transcriptional Activity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36495136/)

In Dr. Cavanaugh's lab, I helped develop new fruit fly lines used to monitor the activity of circadian clock genes in specific tissues. These flies produce a light-emitting enzyme, luciferase, in targeted tissues, enabling real-time observation of gene activity. This advancement allowed us to better understand how gene regulation is coordinated across different tissues.

### [Women in Science Enabling Research (WISER) Fellowship](https://www.luc.edu/gannon/wiser.shtml)

The WISER program at Loyola University Chicago supports undergraduate women in STEM by providing research opportunities and mentorship. It fosters a community where students can gain hands-on experience, develop scientific skills, and explore careers in research. I recieved this fellowhip for the 2022-2023 academic school year, allowing me to work and learn in a labratory on campus.
